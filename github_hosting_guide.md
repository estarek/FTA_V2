## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account (create one at [github.com](https://github.com/))
- Git installed on your local machine ([download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- Python 3.8+ installed
- All project files from the E-Invoice Fraud Detection project

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub** and navigate to your profile
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. **Fill in repository details**:
   - Repository name: `e-invoice-fraud-detection` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "AI-powered fraud detection system for e-invoices with interactive Streamlit dashboard"
   - Visibility: Choose either "Public" or "Private" (Public is required for free Streamlit deployment)
   - Initialize with a README: Check this option
   - Add .gitignore: Select "Python"
   - Choose a license: Select an appropriate license (e.g., MIT License)
4. **Click "Create repository"**

## Setting Up Your Local Repository

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/e-invoice-fraud-detection.git
   cd e-invoice-fraud-detection
   ```

2. **Organize your project files**:
   Create the following structure in your local repository:
   ```
   e-invoice-fraud-detection/
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── README.md
   ├── requirements.txt
   ├── streamlit_app.py
   ├── fraud_detection_model_trainer.py
   ├── model_artifacts/
   │   ├── fraud_detection_model.joblib
   │   ├── scaler.joblib
   │   ├── label_encoders.pkl
   │   ├── feature_metadata.json
   │   ├── evaluation_metrics.json
   │   ├── risk_scored_invoices.csv
   │   ├── top_risk_invoices.csv
   │   ├── bottom_risk_invoices.csv
   │   ├── anomaly_type_distribution.csv
   │   └── emirate_distribution.csv
   └── data/
       └── README.md  # Explain how to obtain or generate the data
   ```

3. **Create a .gitignore file** (if not already created) to exclude large data files:
   ```
   # Python
   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *$py.class
   *.so
   .Python
   env/
   build/
   develop-eggs/
   dist/
   downloads/
   eggs/
   .eggs/
   lib/
   lib64/
   parts/
   sdist/
   var/
   *.egg-info/
   .installed.cfg
   *.egg

   # Virtual Environment
   venv/
   ENV/

   # Data files
   *.csv
   *.xlsx
   *.xls
   
   # Exceptions - include specific model artifacts
   !model_artifacts/anomaly_type_distribution.csv
   !model_artifacts/emirate_distribution.csv
   !model_artifacts/top_risk_invoices.csv
   !model_artifacts/bottom_risk_invoices.csv
   
   # Jupyter Notebook
   .ipynb_checkpoints

   # IDE
   .idea/
   .vscode/
   *.swp
   *.swo
   ```

4. **Update the README.md** with project information:
   ```markdown
   # E-Invoice Fraud Detection System

   An AI-powered fraud detection system for e-invoices with an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

   ## Features

   - Machine learning model to detect anomalous invoices
   - Interactive dashboard for risk score visualization
   - Geographic analysis of invoice distribution and risk
   - Invoice explorer with search and filtering capabilities

   ## Installation

   1. Clone this repository
   2. Install dependencies:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
   3. Run the Streamlit app:
      ```
      streamlit run streamlit_app.py
      ```

   ## Data

   The app uses synthetic e-invoice data. To generate your own data:
   1. Run the data generation script:
      ```
      python fraud_detection_model_trainer.py
      ```

   ## Dashboard

   The dashboard includes:
   - Model performance metrics
   - Risk score distribution
   - Geographic analysis
   - Invoice explorer

   ## License

   [Your chosen license]
   ```

## Pushing Your Code to GitHub

1. **Add your files** to the Git staging area:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: E-Invoice Fraud Detection System"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Deploying with Streamlit Community Cloud

1. **Sign up for Streamlit Community Cloud**:
   - Go to [streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Deploy your app**:
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository, branch (main), and the path to your Streamlit app file (streamlit_app.py)
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Configure your app** (optional):
   - Set a custom subdomain
   - Configure advanced settings if needed

4. **Access your deployed app**:
   - Once deployment is complete, you'll receive a URL to access your app
   - Share this URL with others to showcase your fraud detection system

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Heroku

1. **Create a Procfile** in your repository:
   ```
   web: streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port $PORT
   ```

2. **Deploy to Heroku**:
   ```bash
   heroku create e-invoice-fraud-detection
   git push heroku main
   ```

### AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud

For production deployments, consider using:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Azure App Service
- Google Cloud Run

Each platform has specific deployment instructions, but they all support Python web applications.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing dependencies**:
   - Ensure all required packages are listed in requirements.txt
   - For Streamlit Cloud, avoid packages with complex C dependencies

2. **File path issues**:
   - Use relative paths in your code
   - Ensure model artifacts are properly included in the repository

3. **Memory limitations**:
   - Streamlit Community Cloud has memory limits
   - Consider reducing model size or data if you encounter memory issues

4. **Deployment fails**:
   - Check the deployment logs
   - Verify your Python version compatibility
   - Ensure your app runs locally without errors
